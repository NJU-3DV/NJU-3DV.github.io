  "SceneDesc": "A snow-covered city street is depicted on a cloudy day. The sidewalk is partially cleared, with snow piled on either side. Tall buildings line the street, and a few people in bright green snowsuits are shoveling snow. A car drives down the street, and various street signs and lights are visible. The atmosphere is cold and quiet, with a sense of the city slowly recovering from a recent snowfall. The overall tone is peaceful, despite the urban setting.",
